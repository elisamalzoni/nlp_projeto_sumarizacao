    "# Projeto: sumarizador de documentos e extração de palavras-chave\n",
    "\n",
    "Projeto em duplas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neste projeto vamos usar o que aprendemos sobre vetorização de documentos e similaridade para construir sumários de documentos. Os sumários serão construídos à partir das sentenças existentes no texto, como se estivéssemos usando uma caneta marcadora de texto para ressaltar as sentenças mais importantes. Este tipo de sumarização é conhecido como sumarização extrativa. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Sumarização\n",
    "\n",
    "Você deve implementar duas técnicas de sumarização de documentos:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "Nesta técnica você deverá:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Vetorizar as sentenças do documento. Teste as várias opções de vetorização que aprendemos (TF-IDF, Doc2Vec, LDA, etc).\n",
    "- Agrupar as sentenças do documento em clusters usando K-Means.\n",
    "- Escolher as sentenças mais próximas do centro do cluster, para cada cluster.\n",
    "- Exibir estas sentenças na ordem em que se apresentaram no texto original.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. TextRank\n",
    "\n",
    "A ideia do TextRank é conectar todas as sentenças entre si através da sua similaridade (e.g. $1 - \\text{distância cosseno}$) em uma *matriz de similaridade*. Nesta matriz a entrada $(i,j)$ representa a similaridade entre as sentenças $i$ e $j$. Sentenças mais informativas tendem a estar conectadas com várias outras sentenças do texto, e servirão como representantes dos assuntos que estão sendo discutidos nestas outras sentenças. Para determinar quais são as sentenças de maior conectividade vamos usar o algoritmo PageRank (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank), que já está implementado na biblioteca `networkx` em Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Veja o artigo https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/11/introduction-text-summarization-textrank-python/ para entender mais sobre essa técnica. Para conhecer os detalhes finos do algoritmo, veja o artigo original em https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/papers/mihalcea.emnlp04.pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "Implemente o TextRank e use-o para determinar as sentenças mais importantes do documento. Apresente estas sentenças na ordem em que aparecem no documento original.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Extração de palavras-chave\n",
    "\n",
    "As mesmas técnicas de sumarização de documentos servem para extrair palavras-chave de documentos: basta considerar a similaridade entre embeddings de palavras ao invés de vetores de sentença!\n",
    "\n",
    "Implemente também a extração de palavras-chave de documentos.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Testando as implementações\n",
    "\n",
    "Para testar suas implementações de sumarização você pode usar o dataset \"CNN/Daily Mail\" (https://github.com/abisee/cnn-dailymail). Cuidado: é um dataset bem grande, para testar seus desenvolvimentos é recomendável não rodar no corpus inteiro toda vez.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Entregáveis\n",

    "- O repositório com o código\n",
    "- Um relatório completo: \n",
    "    - Introdução\n",
    "        - Explicar o que é sumarização de texto, diferentes tipos, e fazer uma revisão bibliográfica pequena\n",
    "        - Explicar os dois algoritmos\n",
    "    - Métodos\n",
    "        - Explicar o experimento: qual dataset, como vai medir desempenho, etc.\n",

The Russian player has no problems in openly speaking about it and in a recent interview she said: 'I don't really hide any feelings too much. I think everyone knows this is my job here. When I'm on the courts or when I'm on the court playing, I'm a competitor and I want to beat every single person whether they're in the locker room or across the net.So I'm not the one to strike up a conversation about the weather and know that in the next few minutes I have to go and try to win a tennis match. I'm a pretty competitive girl. I say my hellos, but I'm not sending any players flowers as well. Uhm, I'm not really friendly or close to many players. I have not a lot of friends away from the courts.' When she said she is not really close to a lot of players, is that something strategic that she is doing? Is it different on the men's tour than the women's tour? 'No, not at all. I think just because you're in the same sport doesn't mean that you have to be friends with everyone just because you're categorized, you're a tennis player, so you're going to get along with tennis players. I think every person has different interests. I have friends that have completely different jobs and interests, and I've met them in very different parts of my life. I think everyone just thinks because we're tennis players we should be the greatest of friends. But ultimately tennis is just a very small part of what we do. There are so many other things that we're interested in, that we do.'\""
