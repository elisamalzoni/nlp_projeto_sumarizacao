    "# Projeto: sumarizador de documentos e extração de palavras-chave\n",
    "---\n",
    "#### Elisa Malzoni e Bruna Kimura\n",
    "---\n",
    "Projeto em duplas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neste projeto vamos usar o que aprendemos sobre vetorização de documentos e similaridade para construir sumários de documentos. Os sumários serão construídos à partir das sentenças existentes no texto, como se estivéssemos usando uma caneta marcadora de texto para ressaltar as sentenças mais importantes. Este tipo de sumarização é conhecido como sumarização extrativa. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Sumarização\n",
    "\n",
    "Você deve implementar duas técnicas de sumarização de documentos:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "    Nesta técnica você deverá:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Vetorizar as sentenças do documento. Teste as várias opções de vetorização que aprendemos (TF-IDF, Doc2Vec, LDA, etc).\n",
    "    - Agrupar as sentenças do documento em clusters usando K-Means.\n",
    "    - Escolher as sentenças mais próximas do centro do cluster, para cada cluster.\n",
    "    - Exibir estas sentenças na ordem em que se apresentaram no texto original.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. TextRank\n",
    "\n",
    "    A ideia do TextRank é conectar todas as sentenças entre si através da sua similaridade (e.g. $1 - \\text{distância cosseno}$) em uma *matriz de similaridade*. Nesta matriz a entrada $(i,j)$ representa a similaridade entre as sentenças $i$ e $j$. Sentenças mais informativas tendem a estar conectadas com várias outras sentenças do texto, e servirão como representantes dos assuntos que estão sendo discutidos nestas outras sentenças. Para determinar quais são as sentenças de maior conectividade vamos usar o algoritmo PageRank (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank), que já está implementado na biblioteca `networkx` em Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Veja o artigo https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/11/introduction-text-summarization-textrank-python/ para entender mais sobre essa técnica. Para conhecer os detalhes finos do algoritmo, veja o artigo original em https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/papers/mihalcea.emnlp04.pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "    Implemente o TextRank e use-o para determinar as sentenças mais importantes do documento. Apresente estas sentenças na ordem em que aparecem no documento original.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Extração de palavras-chave\n",
    "\n",
    "As mesmas técnicas de sumarização de documentos servem para extrair palavras-chave de documentos: basta considerar a similaridade entre embeddings de palavras ao invés de vetores de sentença!\n",
    "\n",
    "Implemente também a extração de palavras-chave de documentos.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Testando as implementações\n",
    "\n",
    "Para testar suas implementações de sumarização você pode usar o dataset \"CNN/Daily Mail\" (https://github.com/abisee/cnn-dailymail). Cuidado: é um dataset bem grande, para testar seus desenvolvimentos é recomendável não rodar no corpus inteiro toda vez.\n",

She, by contrast, was not', 'All the other girls, half-glimpsed disappearing down escalators on the Tube, fell off the edge of the world. This time it was different. It was a physical reaction that consumed my whole being.\\xa0', \"And I know I’m not alone. Many of my male friends have admitted the same thing occurred when they met 'the one'. In fact, two of my close friends have gone on to marry Clare’s friends, and they also said they knew immediately.\", 'She spoke. It was posh-Purdey from the New Avengers with a street-cred dash of South London. ‘This is my fiance,’ she announced, gesturing to some bloke at her side.', 'I’d done it again: fallen for the girl I could never get; tilted my hat at the impossible object of desire. Except this time I put up a fight. This girl was real, not a fantasy. She had a home phone number, and her brother Bill, with whom I’d shared many drunken conversations on the trials of love, also proved an early ally in the great quest.', 'Battle was joined. I had my first proper job and Clare was conveniently in her final year at university, away from London, so there were plenty of potential chinks in my love rival’s armour. What a rat I was being. But I was in love — and that justified everything.', 'Time passed. I’d fallen in love in an instant, while she was still shilly-shallying round after three months, and was still engaged!\\xa0', 'And so we traversed the landscape of young love behaving like we were something out of Brief Encounter. There were visits to art-house cinemas, nights drinking in out-of-the-way pubs (where none of our friends would see us) and autumnal, leaf-kicking walks in suitably obscure locations.', 'When at parties with mutual friends around, we’d pretend we hardly knew each other. Just getting away with it was terrifically exciting.There were rows and sulks. Serial monogamy was clearly more honourable for Clare than sleeping with two men and not telling one of them. I just wanted to get on with it.', \"Love at first sight: William Shakespeare's Romeo is immediately smitten by the beautiful Juliet\", \"Lightening bolt: Nicholas Cage's character in City of Angels gives up immortality for love\", 'But, little by little, I won this guerilla war. Not just to make Clare love me, but to make her confident enough to break off her engagement — which, after six months, she did.', 'No wonder women take longer to fall in love — there’s so much to be sure of. Why trust a guy who says it’s you, and you only? How many others has he said that to?', 'Perhaps I was lucky. I fell in love at first sight with someone who seemed like yet another impossible object of desire. Except she wasn’t. Eventually, she loved me back — and still does.\\xa0', 'HER: IT TAKES AT\\xa0 LEAST SIX MONTHS', \"A tall, handsome boy I’d only met for the first time earlier that day was looking down at me and smiling. 'Can I get you a glass of champagne?' he said.\", 'Christy, my older brother Bill’s best friend from university, had been paying way too much attention to me all evening, and this had not gone unnoticed by my boyfriend of two years, who had recently become my fiance.', 'I was flattered, but also extremely flustered. In the whole time we’d been dating I hadn’t looked at another man. Now I felt confused.', 'I’d never met Christy before but he was intelligent, charming, attractive and very funny. We chatted for an hour, I drank far too much, and I realised the next morning I’d agreed to meet him the following weekend.', 'My brother was thrilled. He loved the thought I might start dating his friend. My parents liked Christy, too, but my close friends were appalled. For them, my boyfriend and I had almost become part of the furniture.\\xa0', 'So I didn’t tell them (or my boyfriend, obviously) when I went to a party with Christy the following weekend. Looking back, I feel ashamed of my behaviour. My parents had always told me never to do anything I wouldn’t like someone else to do to me.', 'I never intended to hurt my fiance, but was worried how I could find someone else so attractive while I was supposed to be in love with him. I thought it was better to find out now rather than after we were married.', 'I enjoyed that party a lot. I liked Christy a lot. He was chaotic (he still is) but great fun. Although I didn’t do anything more than kiss him goodbye at the end of the night, I felt terribly guilty.\\xa0', 'So I decided not to see him again. I convinced myself it was just a passing crush. Over the next two months, however, I began to think about him more and more. I tried to listen to my\\xa0 friends who reminded me that Christy had never been out with anyone for more than a few months, so why should I be any different?\\xa0', 'I knew there was an element of truth to their words: even at 21, I realised men fall in love so much more easily than women.\\xa0', 'I was in my final year at university, while Christy was working for a magazine publishing company in London. I still saw him occasionally at weekends, when he came to see Bill.\\xa0', 'Often I’d find myself chatting over breakfast with him and catch myself feeling jealous if I thought he’d been out with another girl\\xa0 the night before. And still he made\\xa0 me laugh.\\xa0', 'So when he suggested going for a walk together, I agreed. Then I found myself agreeing to see a film. Before long, I was seeing him regularly. I knew it\\xa0 was wrong, but I convinced myself\\xa0 that as long as we weren’t sleeping together it didn’t technically count as being unfaithful.', 'As the weeks went on, and after much agonising, I decided to break off my engagement. How could I marry when I had feelings for another man?', 'Finishing with my fiance was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done, and even though I was now free to start seeing Christy, I was too upset to do so. I spent evenings weeping during my university finals, feeling wretched and unsure.\\xa0', \"In the meantime, both Christy and my ex were bombarding me with phone calls. My father’s observation that: 'Well, you don’t have to marry either of them,' was no great help.\", 'Eventually, I agreed to meet Christy again, and this time I had no doubts. I remember the day I knew I was in love. He took me to lunch to meet his sister and brother-in-law, where he sat down and played blues piano to his six-year-old niece. That was it for me. He was already wonderful company: now I could see he was warm and compassionate, too.', 'So, yes, it probably took me six months to fall in love with Christy, not just one meeting. People may assume it’s us women who fall in love instantly, but for me it was a slow burn, and I needed time to deliberate.\\xa0', 'Yet once I was certain, I never doubted it. Six months later, Christy asked me\\xa0 to meet him at the Ritz Hotel bar, and\\xa0 he proposed. ‘Nothing would make me happier,’ I answered. And it was true.', '\\u2009Clare and Christy Campbell’s latest book, Bonzo’s War, will be published by Constable and Robinson this autumn.']\n",

If left untreated, the condition can leave a person up to five times more likely to develop heart disease or have a stroke, and at risk of foot problems due to nerve damage and poor circulation.\", \"Rates of type 2 diabetes are soaring due to increasing obesity, unhealthy diets, a lack of exercise and an ageing population. Geoff was first diagnosed with diabetes in 2003. But it wasn't until a visit to a podiatrist in August 2013 that the gravity of his situation was laid bare.\", \"'Dad had an ulcer that was giving him a lot of discomfort,' Anthony says.

Until then, in his mind having diabetes was just popping a few more pills in addition to ones he was already on for his high blood pressure and cholesterol. This was the wake-up call we all needed.'\", 'He now loves to cycle, never eats take-aways and counts kale and couscous among his favourite foods', \"Anthony and Ian knew drastic action was needed. 'Dad obviously had weight issues which we'd talked about in the past, but we had busy lives so didn't really push it as far as we could have done,' says Anthony.\", \"Step one was to overhaul Geoff's diet. Out went the convenience foods and in came a strict two-month, 800 calorie-a-day diet under the watchful eye of professor Roy Taylor at Newcastle University. He is conducting a study, funded by charity Diabetes UK, which aims to see if a low-calorie diet can permanently reverse type 2 diabetes.\", \"Step two was to encourage Geoff to be more active, to improve his fitness and outlook on life. 'We wanted him to find a social life and hobby other than work and food – we've done everything from fishing to t'ai chi,' Anthony says. 'But we knew he had to take up an achievable form of exercise that didn't put pressure on his foot, so cycling became a big part of his regime.'\", \"He adds: 'Of course there were rows, especially when he was on the low-calorie diet. He'd enjoyed food in the past, but it was the wrong food and here we were telling him it was no good for him, and he had to cook dishes from scratch.\", \"'It's a fine balance taking on an almost parental role with your own dad. We had to be encouraging, but firm, without him feeling he was being bullied into anything.'\", \"That's where the filming proved so useful. Anthony explains: 'Filming the whole process meant we could show him footage from a couple of weeks before as a motivator so he could see how far he'd come.'\", \"In February last year, the sons took their father on a ten-day cycling trip to Spain. Geoff also tried out a sky-dive simulator (he's planning to do one for real later this year), and tackled rock-climbing.\", \"'He'd spent almost four decades doing soul-destroying night shifts, eating large amounts of processed food and doing no exercise.\", \"'We wanted to inspire him, to show him how great life could be,' Anthony says.\", \"'While the weight loss is fantastic, what is really amazing is his new self-confidence , his self-belief and his love of life.'\", 'Step three was transforming Geoff into a diabetes champion, so he could convince others to turn their lives around. Now a trimmer 14 stone, Geoff has taken part in the Prudential 100-mile cycle race, spoken at medical conferences throughout Europe and stopped his diabetes in its tracks.', 'At the most recent meeting with his consultant, he was told he is diabetes-free.', \"Geoff believes the doctors had been 'too nice for too long', and wishes they had been tougher on him. 'I'm just so cross I lived for so long with such a bad quality of life, depressed and basically killing myself. Hopefully my transformation can inspire others too.'\", \"Fixing Geoff's diabetes has brought the family closer, says Anthony.

But the CPRE has discovered the pretty market town, on the ancient Icknield Way path, will be effectively cut into three by the lorries’ routes.', 'Princes Risborough’s mayor and district councillor Alan Turner said: ‘People will be mortified. Our roads network is already in a shocking state through lack of investment, so having so many of these great big lorries will cause serious damage.', '‘This will surely affect property prices – after all, once these trucks start rolling and prospective buyers see large numbers of these vehicles trundling through, it’s bound to deter people. Safety is also a huge concern – we already have around 16,000 vehicle movements a day through Risborough and only a few weeks back a young boy was knocked down on a zebra crossing and seriously injured.’', 'The film director behind the iconic James Bond title sequences expressed his horror at trucks coming through his home village of Caversfield, Oxfordshire.', 'Daniel Kleinman, 57, owns a\\xa0 manor house which has the village’s stunning 12th Century church in its grounds. Mr Kleinman said he could scarcely believe he and neighbours hadn’t been told about the HS2 traffic and said: ‘I think it’s very underhand and unfair that small villages in rural places should be subjected to something like this for so many years without people being asked about it.', '‘We already have a traffic problem here so I can only imagine this is going to make it a lot worse.’', 'In Charwelton, Northamptonshire, Mike Rowell, 56, a project manager for Jaguar Land Rover, said: ‘I knew absolutely nothing about this. Why is it not part of the public consultation process?', '‘We need to be aware about this if it’s going to have a significant negative impact on our house prices.', '‘We only moved here six months ago, to get away from it all. It’s a fantastic place –\\xa0 you come here to forget about\\xa0 everything. But if huge convoys\\xa0 of lorries are going up and down 24/7, there’s going to be a hell of\\xa0 a noise.’', 'In the tiny village of Wing, Bucks, Jane Clarke 67, shuddered at the prospect of more heavy lorries storming past her 16th Century cottage, which sits on a busy tight bend. The retired NHS administrator, whose home was built in 1556, said: ‘This road is already an absolute nightmare. The traffic is constant and never stops as\\xa0 it is.', '‘I don’t understand why they are wasting\\xa0 so much money on a high-speed rail line when we need a bypass around the\\xa0 village. To me, it’s a total\\xa0 nonsense.', '‘We have two schools in the village and I don’t think any one has thought about the safety aspect of having heavy goods vehicles coming through. It’s a recipe for disaster.’', 'In a statement, the CPRE said:\\xa0 ‘HS2 was supposed to free up space on the railways to get lorries off\\xa0 the roads.', 'Progress: The M1 pictured in 1971, many supporters of HS2 liken critics to those who opposed the building and expansion of the central motorway in the fifties and sixties', 'Fierce critic: UKIP leader Nigel Farage is strongly opposed to HS2', '‘But people in dozens of sleepy villages many miles from the route will be finding out today that it could mean the opposite for them.', '‘The plans for building it would mean endless convoys of lorries\\xa0 taking to their local roads, at best destroying their peace and quiet, at worst putting local people’s lives\\xa0 in danger.', '‘Less than ten per cent of the materials required to build HS1 were taken by road.', '‘The Government seems not to want to try to beat the standard set by HS1 in terms of minimising HGV construction traffic on local roads. This simply isn’t good enough.', '‘If these roads are not going to break up under the strain, the Government needs to give additional funding to local authorities to tackle the maintenance backlog for roads in the areas likely to be affected.', '‘Many rural roads have no safe space for walking, cycling or horse riding, so new parallel paths should be considered along routes likely to be affected by construction traffic.’', 'Hilary Wharf, from the HS2\\xa0 Action Alliance, a campaign group set up to challenge the high-speed rail link, said: ‘The Government has not been honest about how extensively HS2 will blight people’s homes and disrupt their lives.', '‘Experience shows that people on the route lose 30 per cent of the value of their homes.', '‘So people who thought they were safe from HS2 will be given an unpleasant surprise.’', 'Among the other effects of HS2 will be that areas of tranquillity such as Danes Moor in Northamptonshire, site of the Wars of the Roses Battle of Edgecote Moor, and the village of Cubbington, Warwickshire, will face disruption\\xa0', 'In Phase Two of the project, the lines extending from Birmingham to Manchester and Leeds will blight other peaceful spots, such as Waterton Park in West Yorkshire and\\xa0 Cannock Chase and Fradley Junction in Staffordshire.', 'Several picturesque locations will also be permanently transformed by embankments, viaducts and cuttings, including 16th Century Lightshaw Hall in Golborne, Wigan,\\xa0 which could face demolition, and a Roman site at Red Hill in Ratcliffe-on-Soar, Nottinghamshire, where a viaduct could be built.', 'An HS2 spokesman said: ‘We have considered all construction access routes as part of the development of the draft Environmental Statement on which we consulted earlier\\xa0 this year.', '‘The consultation was open to all members of the public to respond and express potential concerns or suggest alternatives. We have sought to provide construction access with minimal disruption and will continue to work with local communities to take on board their views.', '‘In developing the subsequent formal Environmental Statement, we will be considering how we can further reduce any adverse impacts.’', 'The spokesman added: ‘HS2 Ltd is still developing transport routes for the construction of the line, accordingly it is not possible to definitively say how the road network will be used. The information supplied to the CPRE is based on the most accurate assessment, given the progress of the line’s design at the time.’']\n",
